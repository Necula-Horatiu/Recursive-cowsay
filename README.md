# Recursive-cowsay
This is a recursive little script that creates a recursive cowsay program


## Run instructions:
./moo.sh N message
Where: 
N is the number of times you want the (for lack of a better term) recursive cow to appear
message is the message to be displayed by the inner most cow

Make sure you chmod u+x before trying to run
